 * test code labels especially when mutating
 * gravity
 * some particles sticking to others
 * reproduction
 * particles working together forming a new kind of particle

probably too ambitious:
 * more interesting natural formations
 * circular planet, use polar coordinates for everything
 * day/night cycle
 * seasons as the planet rotates around the star
 * temperature
